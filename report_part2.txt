a) We have used the CMU Twitter POS tagger in order to extract the part-of-speech of the tokens. To do so, there were some steps to take, which are explained in the following:
1. First, the tagset style was not exactly the same as the Penn TreeBank style and the problem was that the tagger used its own style. As a result, we had to use other models for the POS tagger that matched the output format of the tags as the PTB style. In order to do that, we have employed two of the already existing models in their website, called model.ritter_ptb_alldata_fixed.20130723 and model.irc.20121211, to train the POS tagger. The reason why we have used two models is to improve the accuracy.
2. Second,the output format of the file needed to be changed so that we could do the comparison. Regarding the format change, we programmed in Java to get the favorite output format, which has been attached.
3. The complete output of the tagger has been submitted as POS_results.txt    

The first twenty sentences are tagged as follows:
DREAM_NN 
Too_RB much_JJ hw_NN

I_PRP feel_VBP .._: Blah_UH ._.

b) In order to calculate the accuracy, we have programmed in java and calculate the accuracy as the number of the correctly tagged tokens divided by the total number of tokens in the corpus. The accuracy is 95.02%. In the following, we have shown some incorrect tags for some random sentences:

results:Remember_VB money_NN cant_MD buy_VB us_PRP true_JJ happiness_NN 
expected:Remember_VB money_NN cant_MD buy_VB us_PRP true_JJ happiness_NNS

results:Olifs_NNS RT_RT @TheDakari_USR :_: #PussyTasteLike_HT Vanilla_NNP ,_, tasty_JJ hoe_NN ._. 
expected:Olifs_NNP RT_RT @TheDakari_USR :_: #PussyTasteLike_HT Vanilla_NN ,_, tasty_JJ hoe_NN ._.

expected:Haha_UH going_VBG to_TO the_DT store_NN real_RB quick_JJ #lilbro_HT #smashin_HT http://t.co/N1Rheg1S_URL

The obtained results show that first, POS tagger has more difficulty finding the correct format of the verbs and nouns in the context of the sentences. Second, it has difficulty finding the correct tag for some words having more than one part-of-speech such as like or real. It should be noted that for two of the tags such as Close parenthesis and Open parenthesis, the POS tagger used the style (-RRB- and -LRB-). However, these tokens are tagged differently in the expected_output file. As a result, although the tagging is correct, i.e. the tagger finds them open and close parenthesis, we consider these tags incorrect since the notation is different in comparison with the expected ones.
